A collection code snippets and ideas related to building and testing C++ code in Linux. At time of writing, I'm working with the Windows Subsystem in Linux, GCC, and Google Test. I'm using Visual Studio Code as my main editor, but taking this as an opportunity to experiment a little with Vim. 

My goal is to understand C++ better, by extracting myself from the environments and workflows I use in my job. A different compiler, OS and editor should help me to condense some essential ideas about the language itself.
